She formerly worked for AthenaHealth and was a Fellow in the Boston Startup Leadership Program but began her career originating and executing high-return strategic investments at Dawson Capital in New York.

    Attributes of Success

She had to learn what product demand was all about in that certain colors would sell more than other colors, and, that it was necessary for her to buy more balloons then she intended to use in order to meet the demand for certain colors.
